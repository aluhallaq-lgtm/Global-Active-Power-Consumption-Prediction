# Global-Active-Power-Consumption-Prediction
### A machine learning model to predict global active power consumption based on historical data. Utilizes feature engineering for accurate forecasting.

---
##Features

- Loads and explores the household power consumption dataset from CSV

- Handles missing values and performs data cleaning and preprocessing

- Identifies features (Voltage, Current, Temperature, etc.) and the target variable (Global Active Power)

- Uses Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization

- Applies Linear Regression and evaluates performance using RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
